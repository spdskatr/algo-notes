# CompProg Tidbit #1: online K largest elems

## Problem

Given an array, make an online DS that answers queries of the form:

A x: Add x to the DS

R x: Remove x from the DS

Q t k: At time `t` what is the sum of the `k` largest elements.

Queries in O(log MAX) / O(log N), O(MAX) / O(N) space.

## Solution

2 persistent segment trees. One stores the frequency of value occurrences, and the other stores the sum of the values.

To answer queries, simply walk the tree at time t.
