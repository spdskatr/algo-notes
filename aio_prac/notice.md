# AIO Preparatory Set - Notice

There are five problems in this set. I know implementation seems a bit useless since there is no test data, but if you send it to me I will mark it (treat it as a no-feedback exam).

Of course you are allowed to use the specific language documentation that the AIO permits you to use, but avoid trying to use the internet in any other way except for accessing the problems during the 3 hour period. You *may* be caught off guard in this problem set with certain techniques (judging by the fact that I designed it for myself).

Assume that time limit is 1 second and memory limit is 1 GB for each problem.

Oops, the latex is a bit broken. Oh well, deal with it.

### Problems

- [City](city/statement)
- [Watering](watering/statement)
