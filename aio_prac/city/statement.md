# City

You are in the CBD of Melbourne, desperately trying to find your next fix of bubble tea. In order to find a place that sells bubble tea, you decide to conduct a thorough search of the streets.

You know the street network of the CBD consists of $N (1 \leq N \leq 10000)$ roads running roughly east-west and $M (1 \leq M \leq 10000)$ roads running roughly north-south, forming a grid of $N \times M$ road intersections. All adjacent road intersections are spaced exactly $K (1 \leq K \leq 10)â€‹$ light-microseconds apart from each other.

Given $N$, $M$ and $K$, calculate the total length of the streets in Melbourne's CBD, measured in light-microseconds.

## Input

The first and only line of input will contain 3 space-separated integers: $N$, $M$ and $K$.

## Output

The only line of output should contain a single integer, the total length of the streets in Melbourne's CBD, measured in light-microseconds.

### Sample Input 1

```
2 3 2
```

### Sample Output 1

```
14
```

### Explanation

In this example, there are 2 roads running east-west and 3 roads running north-south. This means there are 7 lengths of road running between the 6 intersections. As the intersections are spaced 2 light-microseconds apart, the total length is 14 light-microseconds.
