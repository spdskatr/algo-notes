# AIO Preparatory Set - Problems

Note: This set of problems is meant to be *harder* than a typical AIO contest. It is meant for you to practice what you would do in a worst case situation at the AIO.

There are five problems. Q5 is extra hard to implement so i guess it should be considered as two problems right?

Although there is no test data or judging, this set is intended to be an implementation exercise.

**PLEASE READ THE [NOTICE](notice) BEFORE STARTING!**
